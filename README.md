FORMIDABLE
------------------

### Introduction
Formidable is a MVVM framework for .NET Winform solutions that aims to provide the simplify the process of isolating your business logic from your UI logic. 

### Why winforms? Isn't it dead already?...
Well, this is a good question. Even if the tendency is for Winforms to die the slow death of platform-specific technologies it is still being used in multiple custom "business-critical" enterprise solutions in multiple companies. This same project was born of my experience dealing with maintaining legacy winforms applications.

### Purpose and use cases
This framework is not intended to make you bring back Winforms to use it with your next project, and I would not advice it at all, go Univeral or WPF at least. But, if you need to create, maintain or extend a legacy winforms app, please feel free to give it a try. It should help you keep your experience a little bit better.

### Use Cases:
1. Extend a legacy Winforms app.
2. Create a new Winforms app.
3. Isolate Winforms app logic for future migration.
4. Add Automated Unit Testing to a Winforms application.

## Benefits:
1. Business logic isolated from ui logic.
2. Centralized Form State accessible through the Form View Model.
3. Form Business Logic (Form View) is fully testable.
4. Form State can be persisted and reloaded. 

### Limitations
All winforms technology limitations
